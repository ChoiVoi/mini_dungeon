        <th>Spider</th>
        <th><img src = "entitiesImg/Spider.png"></th>
        <th>Spiders spawn at random locations in the dungeon from the beginning of the game. When the spider spawns, they immediately move the 1 square upwards (towards the top of the screen) and then begin 'circling' their spawn spot (see a visual example below).<br> 
        <img src = "entitiesImg/spider_movement1.png" width= "200"  height = "200"><br>
        Spiders are able to traverse through walls, doors, switches, portals, exits (which have no effect), but not boulders, in which case it will reverse direction (see a visual example below). <br>
        <img src = "entitiesImg/spider_movement2.png" width= "200"  height = "200"><br>
        Spiders spawn in a square that is less than or equal to a radius of 20 (via Manhattan distance) around the playerâ€™s current position. If there is no available space, a spider is not spawned. Spiders cannot spawn on boulders, or in the same square as the player/enemies. If a spider is stuck between two boulders in its movement path, it should remain still.

They constantly move towards the Player, stopping only if they cannot move any closer (they are able to move around walls). Mercenaries are limited by the same movement constraints as the Player. All mercenaries are considered hostile, unless the Player can bribe them with a certain amount of gold; in which case they become allies. Mercenaries must be within a certain radius of the player in order to be bribed, which is formed by the diagonally and cardinally adjacent cells in a "square" fashion, akin to the blast radius for bombs. As an ally,  the mercenary moves randomly.</th>

        <tr>
        <th>Assassin</th>
        <th><img src = "entitiesImg/Assassin.png"></th>
        <th>Assassins are exceptionally powerful mercenaries which deal significantly more damage. When bribing an Assassin, there is a certain chance that the bribe will fail; the gold will be wasted and the Assassin will remain hostile. Battles still do not occur with an Assassin when the player is invisible.</th>

        <th>As part of this, you will need to extend your solution to accommodate the idea of a swamp tile. These are tiles that have an x and y position and remain fixed throughout the entire game. They slow the movement of all entities through them, except for the player and allies adjacent to the player. Each swamp file has a movement factor which is a multiplying factor of the number of ticks it takes to traverse the tile.<br>
        For example, let us say the movement factor for a swamp tile is 2: <br>
        1. Tick 1: MOve onto the swamp tile
        2. Tick 2: Stuck on the swamp tile
        3. Still stuck on the swamp tile
        4. Move off the swamp tile</th>

When a bomb is cardinally adjacent to an active switch, it destroys all entities in diagonally and cardinally adjacent cells, except for the player, forming a "square" blast radius. The bomb should detonate when it is placed next to an already active switch, or placed next to an inactive switch that then becomes active. The bomb explodes on the same tick it becomes cardinally adjacent to an active switch. A bomb cannot be picked up once it has been used.</th>

        <th>A standard melee weapon. Swords can be collected by the Player and used in battles, increasing the amount of damage they deal by an additive factor. Each sword has a specific durability that dictates the number of battles it can be used before it deteriorates and is no longer usable.</th>

        <th>A special form of treasure, hard and treasuable. It can be picked up by the player. Can be used to open doors, and can be used interchangeably with treasure or keys when building entities. But it cannot be used to bribe mercenaries or assassins. Since it is classed as treasure it counts towards the treasure goal. When used for opening doors, or when replacing another material such as a key or treasure in building entities, it is retained after use.</th>

        <th>Can be crafted with (1 wood OR 2 arrows) + (1 key OR 1 treasure) + (1 sun stone).

### Goals
each dungeon also has a goal that defines what must be achieved by the player for the dungeon to be considered complete. 

### Basic goals are:
1. Getting to an exit
2. having aboulder on all switches
3. Collecting a certain number of treasure items(or more)

### Complex goals are:
1. Collecting a certain number of treasure AND getting to an exit
2. Collecting a certain number of treasure OR having a boulder on all floor switches
3. Getting to an exit AND (destroying all enemies OR collecting all treasure)

# Winning & Losing
The game is won when all the goals are achieved. The game is lost when the player dies and is removed from the map.
